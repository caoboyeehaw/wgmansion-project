This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

frontend dependencies notes:
- shadcn
- tailwindcss
- recharts

conisderations:
- might consider aceternity ui for some fancy fx, and radix icons for more use of icons.
- future plans include designing custom modals using shadcn component ~ component art i guess??
